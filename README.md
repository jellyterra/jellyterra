### GPG

- *8A4D 52DC 8F88 4F06* ends on 2024.03.01: GPG keypair lost, all commits signed with it are now marked "Unverified"
- *BF65 7865 AA3A BC32* ends on 2025.03.11: private key lost because I exported moved-to-card renewal private key to the same path of expired private key so it's overwritten and gone. What a pity, I really love this key id sequence!
- **E644 440D CB00 0C41** is the GPG key ***now in use***.
