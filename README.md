### GPG

- *8A4D 52DC 8F88 4F06* ends on 2024.03.01: GPG keypair lost, all commits signed with it are now marked "Unverified"
- *BF65 7865 AA3A BC32* ends on 2025.03.11: private key lost because I exported moved-to-card renewal private key to the same path of expired private key so it's overwritten and gone. What a pity, I really love this key id sequence!
- **E644 440D CB00 0C41** is the GPG key ***now in use***.

> All history of my past GitHub activities during 2017-2020 is lost due to account deletion.

Life is short, is not enough to do many things.
But I hope my life to be fulfilling and my visions about technologies and society to become true.

### lost+found

My first GitHub account was registered in 2017 for GitHub Pages.

Writing about my past, is my way of making peace with self, comforting myself.

[Here](https://www.jellyterra.com/#lostfound) are the ideas and repos I've **dropped** in the past. Most of them were just ideas and had not been fully implemented.

And all the passion came back again since 2023, which means a lot to me. New domains, fantastic mates, inspiring future ... which is a rebirth, a new beginning.
