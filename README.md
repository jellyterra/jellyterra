I am learning and working on:

*   Compilers and program analysis

*   Digital hardware design

*   DIY circuit boards and applications with KiCad

*   Infrastructure

*   Productivity and automation tools

I have mainly focused on learning hardware architecture and PL theory since 2023.

But my knowledge in these is still shallow. I CRAVE GUIDANCE! **:D**

Life is short. Three twenty of years is not enough to do many things.
I hope my life to be fulfilling and my visions about technologies and society to become true.

### Security Notices

- Mar 1, 2024: I lost the GPG keypair 8A4D52DC8F884F06, all commits signed with it are marked "Unverified".

### Bookshelf

I do **not** have finished reading all of these books, some just got started or are in the process of being read.

These are the paper books I own below. My reading has switched to e-books to save costs since 2023.

Due to an HTML book, my 1st GitHub account is registered (2017) for Pages.

### lost+found

***The less you have, the more you fear losing.***

Writing about past, is my way of making peace with past self, a way to comfort myself.

Here are the ideas and repos I've **dropped** in the past. Most of them were just ideas and had not been fully implemented:

> **2018 On-EasyAccess**
>
> A **failed** xml-based database Go program that **failed** in a competition held by the city.
>
> But it is one of the important bonds with the info-tech teacher Zhang in the last semester of my primary school time.

> **2018 LangVM Project**, which is different with 2023 [one](https://github.com/langvm/).
>
> Motivated to create a purely functional high-level VM as an alternative to the JVM, and provide native compilation support at the same time.
>
> The thing beyond my mind is: it has similar inspiration and motivation with LLVM's, but I didn't know about it that time! [(The last paragraph in Page 3, Preface)](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/course/spring2018/CS131/llvm.pdf)
>
> As of the time the repository was removed, only an untested interpreter was implemented. LOL
>
> Luckily, there is a Chrome offline webpage capture taken in 2019 saved on my cloud drive. I uploaded it and can be found [here](https://github.com/jellyterra/jellyterra/tree/main/lost-and-found/).
>

> **2018 Lava, Oops, Cheese etc.**
>
> VM-level assembly, high-level and even localized programming languages designed for LangVM.
>
> This is why I bought the "dragon book".

> **2019 Ketchup Graphics**
>
> A simple graphics engine based on OpenGL.
>
> This is why I bought the books about OpenGL. But today we should use Vulkan. xD

> **2019 Divine Comedy and Reality**
>
> Make the story and three realms of Divine Comedy into a game. I found that I was not able to do it that time -- even will never be. **I hope someone/producer can do it.** (for me)

The deletion of my past accounts and activities is a **great regret** for me, which I must to get out from.

2023 means a lot to me. New domains, fantastic mates, inspiring future ...

***It is a rebirth, a new beginning ...***
